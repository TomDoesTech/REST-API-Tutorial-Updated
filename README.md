# Build a REST API with Node.js, Mongoose & TypeScript

Note: This repository includes the [postman collection for the finished API](postman_collection.json)

Note 2: Make sure you add .env to your .gitignore before pushing any changes to your repository. You will also want to generate new public & private keys

#### Generate new keys: https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/

#### Base64 encode the keys: https://base64.guru/converter/encode/text

The previous website no longer works or is difficult to use for some unknown reason. The updated one works with ease. Thank you.
